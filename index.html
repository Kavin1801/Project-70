                        This is the Hogwarts Quidditch pitch.Quidditch is a wizarding sport played on broomsticks(flying ones of course).There are four balls that fly around and 7 players:Three Chasers,Two Beaters,a Keeper and a Seeker.The Quaffle,two Bludgers and a Golden Snitch:the hardest one to catch as it is very small and very fast.The Bludgers aren't meant to be caught-they destroy a teams.That is when the beaters come in to drive them away to the opposite team.The seeker's job is to catch the golden snitch and that is when the game ends.There are 3 loops at each end of the pitch which are the goals.<br>

                <p>The Triwizard Tournament is an inter-school magical competition that consists of three dangerous tasks. The winner receives a cup, 1000 Galleons and 'eternal glory'.Dating back around 700 years, this contest of intelligence, courage and wizards-losing-their-minds-because-there's-a-dragon-half-a-metre-away was traditionally held every five years between the three biggest wizarding schools in Europe: Durmstrang, Beauxbatons and Hogwarts.</p>

    According to legend, before he left, Salazar Slytherin created a secret chamber deep underground in Hogwarts Castle — known as the Chamber of Secrets. That Chamber was home to a monster — a Basilisk — that was allegedly supposed to purge the school of all Muggle-borns. The Basilisk,also known as the King of Serpents, may reach a gingatic size, and live many hundres of years. Its methods of killing are most wondrous, for aside from its deadly and venomous fangs, the Basilisk has a murderous stare, and all those who are fixed with the beam os its eye shall suffer instant death. In his second year, Harry Potter and Ronald Weasley found the entrance to the chamber, killed the heir of Slytherin and the Basilisk, and rescued a student.
